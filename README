HelpfulValidations
==================

A simple plugin for allowing you to easily test that particular fields on your model are valid (or invalid).


Example
=======

So maybe you want to test if a username is valid without having to make sure all the other fields in the model are valid. The best way I can explain this is if you take the example of a typical couple of lines in a spec:

@user.attributes = @valid_attributes.except( :username )
@user.valid? #=> false 

Using this plugin the following line achieves the same thing - although this wasn't created to make your specs easier to write.

@user.username_is_valid? #=> false

OR

@user.attribute_is_valid?( :username ) #=> false


Usage
=====

For the following examples of usage, assume User has two fields: :username, :first_name.

User.username_is_valid?( "username" )                                             #=> true/false
User.attributes_are_valid?( :username => "username", :first_name => "firstname" ) #=> true/false

user = User.new
user.username_is_valid?                              #=> true/false
user.attribute_is_valid?( :username )                # => true/false
user.attributes_are_valid?( :username, :first_name ) #=> true/false
